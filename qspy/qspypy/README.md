About this Directory
====================
This directory contains the Python package "qspypy" that supports 
writing Python test scripts for the QUTest unit testing harness.

NOTE:
"qspypy" has been originally contributed by Dominic Valentino from
Lotus Engineering LLC (https://lotusengineeringllc.weebly.com/).
The package is licensed under the MIT open source license.


General Requirements
====================
The "qspypy" package requires Python 3.6.x or higher as well as
the PyTest 3.6.1, which are freely available from the Internet.

To launch any of the scripts in this directory, you need to first run
the QSPY console application (version 6.x or higher) with the -u option
(the -u option opens up the UDP socket for attaching "front-ends").
Once QSPY is running, you can "attach" to the UDP socket and start
communicating with the QSPY back-end or to the Target (through QSPY).


Using "qpspypy"
===============
The usage of the "qpspypy" is as follows:

python -m qspypy.qutest [test_scripts] [target_exe] [host_ip]

where:
[test_scripts] - optional specification of the Python test scripts to run.
                 If not specified, the scripts are chosen by the general
                 rules of the PyTest framework.

[target_exe]   - optional specification of the target executable to
                 launch for testing embedded code on the host computer.
                 If not specified, an embedded target is assumed.

[host_ip]      - optional IP-address:port for the host running the QSpy
                 utility. If not specified, the default is localhost:7701.

Examples:
python -m qspypy.qutest
python -m qspypy.qutest *.py
python -m qspypy.qutest *.py mingw\dpp.exe
python -m qspypy.qutest *.py mingw\dpp.exe 192.168.1.100:7705
